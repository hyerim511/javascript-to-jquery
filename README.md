# javascript-second

This is our second assignment in WD3 - JavaScript for Web Developers 1.
The purpose of this assigment is to get a good grasp of JavaScript.

★For the second assignment, we need to meet the following conditions with our project:
 
 【Limited Scope Variables】
 Use the let keyword to declare at least one variable inside of a function (so it is not accessible outside of the function) and use that variable to do something in the function;
 【Constant Variables】 
 Use the const keyword to declare at least one constant variable, whose value is never changed, but is used somewhere in the code for some purpose;
 【String Manipulation】 
 Use string values somewhere, along with some string manipulation methods to edit the string and/or look for characters or patterns (regular expressions) on the string;
 【Built-in Functions】
  Use at least one built-in function of JavaScript to do something;
 【Named Functions】 
 Create at least 3 named functions to do something in our code, ensuring our functions are name well (camel case, avoid names similar to built-in functions and methods, present-tense verbs, etc.);
 【Anonymous Function】 
 Use at least one anonymous function somewhere in our code (it can be arrow function but not required, the syntax is up to us);
 【Return Statement】 
 Employ the return keyword at least once in a function to return a value from the function and use it somewhere else in the code;
 【Assignment Operators】 
 Use at least one other assignment operator, besides the basic one (=), somewhere in our code;
 【Arithmetic Operators】 
 Use at least two different arithmetic operators somewhere in our code;
 【Evaluation】 
 Comparison Operators: Use at least two different comparison operators somewhere in our code;
 【Logical Operators】 
 Use at least one logical operator somewhere in our code;
 【Conditional Statement】 
 Have at least one conditional statement somewhere in our code, it can be if-else or switch, its up to us. However, regardless of which one we choose, the condition must evaluate to at least two different scenarios, so we must have an ELSE, or two CASE. 
 【For Loop】 
 We must make use of a For Loop somewhere in our code.
 【While Loop】 
 Have at least one while loop somewhere in our code.
 【Arrays】 
 Have and use at least one array somewhere, adding and removing items from it;
 【Built-in Class】 
 Make use of at least one built-in Class somewhere in the project;
 【Built-in Methods】 
 Make use of at least one built-in method somewhere;
 【Constructor】 
 Instantiate at least one instance of an Object, using a built-in Class, either with the new keyword or another approach, and use that Object for something in the project;
 【Input-Output】 
 Our project must take user input, and then output something based on that input. Acceptable inputs are: typed into form fields, keys pressed, objects dragged around, drawings made on the screen, uploaded files, or options selected (drop-down, checkbox, etc.). Output can be anything that happens on the webpage due to the input given. In other words, the web app should be interactive.

★These conditions are met collectively as a team, so we do not have to individually do all of these things. In the 1st assignment each person coded a mini-app, and each app was independent of each other. This time, we need to make one web-app that is integrated. We have the following options (decide among our team):

 【Option 1】
 Re-Use All: Use what each of us did for the 1st assignment, and come up with a way to combine each individual thing into one web-app. For example, if one person did Weather and the other Carousel, aother person can create a Weather Carousel. Another example, if one person did the Hangman Game and the other a Timer, another person can improve the Hangman Game by adding a Timer, and perhaps other things too.
 【Option 2】 
 Re-Use and Pick New: If we find it difficult to integrate the things we picked, we can decide to re-use one but not the other. For example, if one person picked Carousel and the other Calculator, another person can decide to keep the Carousel but add some other feature from the list instead of a Calculator and combine the new pick with the Carousel.
 【Option 3】 
 Pick New Features: Or you can all pick features from the list that are different from the ones each of you worked on for the 1st assignment, and create something new with those features.

Regardless of which of the options above our team decides to go with, all of our features must be well integrated into one fully functional web app. 

★Other Assignment Requirements
 -Use JavaScript, even if you can achieve your goal with CSS or other things, we must use JavaScript because the goal here is to learn and practice coding with JS
 -Avoid libraries, frameworks, and plugins; code it with pure JS, do not use external libraries such as jQuery or ReactJS, right now the focus is to study JavaScript in its pure form, without relying on any third party tools

★Together with our teammates, pick and choose at least one of the following features, per team member
 【Canvas】 A canvas where you can draw / doodle
 【Calculator】 A calculator that can add, subtract, divide, multiply, and perhaps do other things
 【Timer】 A timer that counts down to 0:00:00 and beeps when its over
 【Stopwatch】 A timer that counts up from 0:00:00 and stops when you press a button/key
 【Rock-Paper-Scissors】 A mini-game of rock paper scissors where the user can play against the game
 【RNG/Dice Roll】 A random number generator where you can roll dice of different kinds
 【Hangman】 A mini-game of Hangman, with random words or puzzles to solve
 【Tic-Tac-Toe】 A mini-game of Tic-Tac-Toe
 【Weather Display】 Showcase weather information for Vancouver, and other locations
 【International Clocks】 Show clocks with the time of Vancouver, and other locations
 【Music Player】 A music player that plays music, includes a play, pause, shuffle buttons, and name of track
 【Carousel】 An image carousel that auto-slides, and has some nice gimmicks (using JavaScript)
 【Form Validation】 A form that has input masking and validation for fields such as email, phone, and others
 【Image Captions】 Hover over images to see a tooltip/modal with information about an image
 【Map Points of Interest】 Hover over coordinates on a map to see information about that location
 【Parallax / Advanced Animations】 Advanced animations and effects that require JS and not just CSS
